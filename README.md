# ev-crosswords
A Wordpress Plugin to easily add crosswords to a wordpress website, available from Wordpress.org here:

https://wordpress.org/plugins/ev-crosswords/

The crosswords exist as text files, in a custom .xml format, and this Plugin allows 
to upload a crossword file, and display it in the frontend for end users to solve.

The crosswords file format is simple and it is explained here: 
https://github.com/TheEntreveloper/crosswords

You can also take a look at a few sample crossword files to quickly make sense
of its format. You can find some here: https://github.com/TheEntreveloper/crosswords/tree/main/data.

While you can create crosswords manually, and upload your files to your 
Wordpress website using this Plugin, it is easier to create those files with the 
Entreveloper Crossword Making Tool, a free Java Desktop App that can be downloaded 
here: https://github.com/TheEntreveloper/crosswords/blob/main/maker/maker.zip

Using this tool you can create Crosswords files interactively, which you can then upload and view, categorize and make available to your visitors.
